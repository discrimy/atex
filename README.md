# aTEX
The project's goal is to learn how async systems are designed and built. The project is a part of course from Strong Programmer School[1] ([more about course](https://education.borshev.com/architecture)).

## Architecture
The project was designed to be async, using Event-Sourcing, Model modeling and others not-so-fun tools (I hope right). The architecture can be views [there (Miro)](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMwBa7ds=/?share_link_id=503168228271).

## Notes
> 1. I hope I translated it right.

> 2. It would be better to share it via image or some file, but free Miro do not allow to export image with not-so-low resolution.
